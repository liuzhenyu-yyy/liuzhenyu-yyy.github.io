    I am a Staff Scientist at Nantional Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. I received my Ph.D. and B.S. from Peking University, advised by <a href="https://biopic.pku.edu.cn/en/researchteam/511476.htm">Prof. Fuchou Tang</a>.
</p>

<p>
    My research primarily revolves around developing innovative single-cell sequencing technologies🧬, as well as utilizing these cutting-edge methods in basic cancer research. Recently, my research has focused on the epigenetic regulation of tumor heterogeneities, encompassing both inter- and intra-tumor variations.
