    I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://biopic.pku.edu.cn/en/">Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center</a> 
    at <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, advised by <a href="https://biopic.pku.edu.cn/en/researchteam/511476.htm">Prof. Fuchou Tang</a>. Before my Ph.D., I received my B.S. in Biology from <a href="https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/index.htm">Yuanpei College</a>, Peking University. During my undergraduate studies, I participated in the Undergraduate Research Training Program at 
    <a href="http://www.cls.edu.cn/en/info/1263/1349.htm">Dr. Chengran Xu's</a> Lab.

    My research primarily revolves around developing innovative single-cell sequencing technologies, as well as utilizing these cutting-edge methods to explore complex biological systems, including cancers and embryos üß¨. Recently, my research has focused on the epigenetic regulation of tumor heterogeneities, encompassing both inter- and intra-tumor variations. Outside of my academic pursuits, I take pride in my membership with the Peking University table tennis varsity team for non-sports students.üèì
