        # Single-cell sequencing reveals clearance of blastula chromosomal mosaicism in IVF babies

        ![Image](:IVF.png)

        While chromosomal mosaic embryos detected by trophectoderm (TE) biopsy 
        offer healthy embryos available for transfer, high resolution postnatal 
        karyotyping and chromosome testing of the transferred embryos are insufficient. 
        Here, we applied single-cell multiomics sequencing for seven infants with blastula 
        chromosomal mosaicism detected by TE biopsy. The chromosome ploidy was examined by 
        singlecell genome analysis with the cellular identity being identified by single-cell 
        transcriptome analysis. A total of 1,616 peripheral leukocyte from seven infants with 
        embryonic chromosomal mosaicism and three control ones with euploid TE biopsy were analyzed. 
        A small number of blood cells showed copy number alterations (CNAs) on seemingly random 
        locations at a frequency of 0-2.5% per infant. However, none of the cells showed CNAs 
        that were with the same as those of the corresponding TE biopsies. The blastula chromosomal 
        mosaicism may be fully self-corrected probably through selective losing of the aneuploid cells 
        during development and the transferred embryos can be born as euploid infants without mosaic CNAs 
        corresponding to the TE biopsies. The results provide a new reference for the evaluations of transferring 
        chromosomal mosaic embryos at certain situations.

        Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
