        # Single-cell Sequencing Reveals Clearance of Blastula Chromosomal Mosaicism in IVF Babies

        ![Image](:IVF.png){:data-align="center"}

        While chromosomal mosaic embryos detected by trophectoderm (TE) biopsy 
        offer healthy embryos available for transfer, high resolution postnatal 
        karyotyping and chromosome testing of the transferred embryos are insufficient. 
        Here, we applied single-cell multiomics sequencing for seven infants with blastula 
        chromosomal mosaicism detected by TE biopsy. The chromosome ploidy was examined by 
        singlecell genome analysis with the cellular identity being identified by single-cell 
        transcriptome analysis. A total of 1,616 peripheral leukocyte from seven infants with 
        embryonic chromosomal mosaicism and three control ones with euploid TE biopsy were analyzed. 
        A small number of blood cells showed copy number alterations (CNAs) on seemingly random 
        locations at a frequency of 0-2.5% per infant. However, none of the cells showed CNAs 
        that were with the same as those of the corresponding TE biopsies. The blastula chromosomal 
        mosaicism may be fully self-corrected probably through selective losing of the aneuploid cells 
        during development and the transferred embryos can be born as euploid infants without mosaic CNAs 
        corresponding to the TE biopsies. The results provide a new reference for the evaluations of transferring 
        chromosomal mosaic embryos at certain situations.

        # Sequential and Distinct Roles of Ngn3 and Neurod1 in Pancreatic Lineage Differentiation

        ![Image](:Ngn3.png){:data-align="center"}

        Cell identities are established through the sequential action of key
        transcription factors (TFs). The current model of pancreas endocrine lineage
        differentiation invokes the transient expression of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
        transcription factor Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) in the trunk cells as the trigger of endocrine
        fate commitment and rapid differentiation to pro-islet cells. Another bHLH transcription
        factor named Neurod1, which is directly regulated by Ngn3, also plays critical roles in
        the pancreatic endocrine specification. Despite the key regulatory function of these
        two TFs, their genomic targets and the regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown.
        Here, we had generated a new transgenic mouse strain to uncover the genome-wide direct
        target of Ngn3 with the CUT&RUN method and performed comprehensive investigations of
        the sequential and distinct chromatin regulatory program mediated by Ngn3 and Neurod1.
        We found that Ngn3 access genome enhancers in highly condensed chromatin regions and
        prompt their activation. The enhancer landscape established by Ngn3 is further maintained
        by the expression of Neurod1. Neurod1 also binds the promoter region of key endocrine TFs to help
        initiate their expression. These data suggest the pioneering ability of Ngn3, with Neurod1 acting
        as a co-factor to maintain the opened chromatin state.

        # Chaotic Model for Insulin-Glucose System
        A chaotic model for the insulin-glucose regulatory system. Using this model, we could mimic
        several common metabolic disorders related to the system and identify key parameters responsible
        for the initiation of these disease.

        ---

        ## Description
        This is my final project in "Mathematical Modeling in the Life Sciences"  Course of 
        [Prof. Louis Tao](http://www.bio.pku.edu.cn/enhomes/news/teacher_dis/68.html) in the spring semaster
        of 2020. Here a novel mathematical model based on [Lotka–Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations)
        was developed to mimic the behaviors of the insulin-glucose system. Numerical simulation indicates that the model has
        various different dynamic behaviors under different conditions, including chaos. Using this model, 
        we could mimic several common metabolic disorders related to the system and identify key parameters 
        responsible for the initiation of these disease.

        ## Model presentation

        Alfred Lotka and Vito Volterra proposed the two-dimension ordinary differential equation model to 
        describe the population dynamics of prey and predator in 1926. Prompted by their model, the relationship 
        of glucose and insulin is also like prey and predator. It’s reasonable to model the insulin-glucose system 
        by making some adjustments to the Lotka–Volterra model.

        The mathematical relationships for the model are formulated as follows:

        $$ \frac{dx}{dt} =-a_1 x+a_2 xy+a_3 y^2+a_4 y^3+a_5 z+a_6 z^2+a_7 z^3+a_{20} $$

        $$ \frac{dy}{dt} =-a_8 xy-a_9 x^2-a_{10} x^3+a_{11} y(1-y)-a_{12} z-a_{13} z^2-a_{14} z^3+a_{21} $$

        $$ \frac{dz}{dt} =a_{15} y+a_{16} y^2+a_{17} y^3-a_{18} z-a_{19} yz $$

        Where x(t) is the concentration of insulin, y(t) is the population of glucose and z(t) is the population 
        density of β-cells. There are 21 distinct model parameters, each has specific biological meaning, as 
        discussed in project report, and could be adjusted to simulate both normal condition and metabolic disorders.

        More information about the model, including time series and state space, stability analysis, bifurcation
        diagrams and chaotic analysis were avaliable at the [project page](https://github.com/liuzhenyu-yyy/Chaotic-Model-for-Insulin-Glucose-System)
